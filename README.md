Chatbots are software applications that use artificial intelligence & natural language processing to understand what a human wants, and guides them to their desired outcome with as little work for the end user as possible. Like a virtual assistant for your customer experience touchpoints.

A well designed & built chatbot will:

* Use existing conversation data (if available) to understand the type of questions people ask.
* Analyze correct answers to those questions through a ‘training’ period.
* Use machine learning & NLP to learn context, and continually get better at answering those questions in the future.

One of the most interesting parts of the chatbot software space is the variety of ways you can build a chatbot. The underlying technology can vary quite a bit, but it really all comes down to what your goals are. At the highest level, there are three types of chatbots most consumers see today:

* Rules-Based Chatbots – These chatbots follow pre-designed rules, often built using a graphical user interface where a bot builder will design paths using a decision tree.
* AI Chatbots – AI chatbots will automatically learn after an initial training period by a bot developer.
